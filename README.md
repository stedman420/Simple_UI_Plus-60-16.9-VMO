- This version is intended for a 16:9 resolution or better.
- Backpack size increased from 32 spaces(4x8) to 120 spaces(8x15).
- Player built storage size increased from 72 spaces(9x8) to 182 spaces(13x14).
- Minibike storage size increased from 18 spaces(6x3) to 180 spaces(15x12).
- Most all windows have been moved up a little to adjust for the smaller UI and make more room.
- Because of the above this version will not be easy to merge with other mods that alter the windows.xml.

#### Notes
You will not see the increased storage size until you build a new storage container or upon building\\rebuilding the minibike. You may even have to start a new game in some cases to see the increased storage size.
